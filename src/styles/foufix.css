/* 

  this is a flash of unstyled theme/font fix
  that works with these older plugins and version of gatsby 
  if you upgrade dependencies to modern versions this does not work
  for content, but fonts are okay. theme will still flash
  should you decide to mess with gatsby dependencies...

  good luck :D
